    <h2>biography</h2>

    <p>Oh, Myungseok (b.1995, Seoul, Korea) is a sound artist and artistic researcher whose work explores how sound can function as a prism—fracturing and refracting our perception of time, space, and reality. His practice examines the paradox between virtual systems and physical experience, seeking to reveal deeper essences beyond what is immediately perceptible.</p>
    <p>He holds a Master of Arts and Science in Art &amp; Technology from Sogang University, where his thesis focused on deep learning and vocalization evaluation, and a BFA in Media Arts from the Seoul Institute of the Arts. His career spans artistic research, sound design, and AI, bridging experimental performance with cutting-edge technology.</p>
    <p>Oh’s work has been presented internationally and supported by organizations such as the Arts Council Korea (ARKO), Seoul Foundation for Arts and Culture (SFAC), and KOCCA. He has participated in residencies at the Stochastic Labs of the Minerva Foundation in Berkeley (2023), La MaMa Umbria at the 61st Spoleto Festival in Italy (2018), and Experimental Film Virginia in the U.S. (2015).</p>
    <p>His projects have been recognized with awards including the KEA Award for Excellence in Research (2022), the ARKO Artist-Producer-Engineer Camp Winner (2022), and a Special Mention at the European Young Theatre for Controller and Driver (2018).</p>
    <p>Currently, Oh works as an independent artistic researcher, sound artist, and sound performer, continuing to develop experimental approaches to temporality, perception, and sonic environments. Alongside his artistic practice, he is also an AI Product Manager at KRAFTON, bridging experimental sound research with technological innovation.</p>
