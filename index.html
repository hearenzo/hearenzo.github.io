  <h3>TRANS III — Sound Objects</h3>
  <p class="meta">2025</p>
  <p>Documentation of sound objects used in TRANS III, exploring the materiality and spatial presence of sound through physical objects.</p>

        <p class="video-caption">This installation is constructed from a single piano wire bent into a loop, with both ends attached to a DC motor. As the motor spins, the wire loop periodically strikes the "barn door" of a theatrical lighting fixture, producing a sharp, percussive sound. This work aims for an auditory visualization of flickering, creating a flicker-like afterimage in the perception of the viewer through the combination of sound and visual blur.</p>

        <p class="video-caption">This installation consists of two cut piano wires of different lengths attached to the axis of a DC motor. As the motor rotates, the piano wires periodically 'strike' the stage railing, creating a crisp "tick-tock" sound, reminiscent of a clock's second hand. This percussive object visualizes mechanical rhythm, repetition, and the passage of time through sound.</p>

        <p class="video-caption">This installation uses the rotational movement of a DC motor, which is amplified by a pendulum and wire. The movement is transmitted to the theater's railing structure via a Super Clamp. The resulting vibrations travel along the railing and spread throughout the entire space, creating a palpable "texture of trembling" and transforming the performance hall into a single, giant resonant instrument.</p>
