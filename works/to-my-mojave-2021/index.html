  “Artists don the attire of art and possess trembling hands.” Through our work, we strive to touch art. We may not know where this journey begins, but what is clear is that we are steadily moving forward.

  This experimental film was produced in 2021 through the “Art Vitality in Everything” program by Urban Culture LAB X Art Bridge Co., Ltd., with support from the Seoul Metropolitan Government and the Seoul Foundation for Arts and Culture. The project was made possible with the support of participating artists.
