<h3>1. Supernova (2019)</h3>
<p>“Supernova” is inspired by the death of a star, which burns the brightest at its last moment, expending all its energy before ending its life. Myungseok Oh applied the image of a supernova to a dead pine tree. The holographic PVC, which creates a disturbance of light as if it is burning without a flame, is a crucial element in transforming the pine tree into a supernova. By stripping off the bark that accompanied its life and overlaying it with holographic PVC at the moment of death, the pine tree’s demise was sublimated into art. This process eternally seals the tree’s greenery and integrity within the artwork. This piece explores the deconstruction of the information recognition process, breaking down and recombining existence itself to imbue it with new meaning, showcasing Myungseok Oh’s unique artistic approach.</p>

<h3>2. Olfactory Sonification (2019)</h3>
<p>The sound installation “Olfactory Sonification (2019)” translates the images perceived in the process of scent recognition into sound. By deconstructing information twice, the work creates a virtual world within the exhibition space. Visitors entering this transformed space, which is no longer just a conventional exhibition hall, will perceive the sounds as an integral part of the constructed environment without question. Myungseok Oh uses this work to employ the constructed space and sounds as tools to express simulation.</p>

<h3>3. Visual Sonification (2019)</h3>
<p>The media art piece “Visual Sonification (2019)” translates the portrait of Marie Antoinette, a woman who loved perfume, into sound. Her image is projected onto a canvas through visual distortion. The piece, with no set beginning or end, exists in infinite variation. The expanding and distorting portrait and the ever-changing sounds demand viewers to recognize the diversity of information perception. It raises the question of whether one should read and interpret the grammar of an artwork or accept it as it is. This work form challenges viewers to reflect on visual literacy.</p>

<h3>4. Rebirth (2019)</h3>
<p>“Rebirth (2019)” is inspired by Myungseok Oh’s sound works. Collaborating artist Wonik Lee chose “aluminum foil” and “sprinkling” as his tools of expression for this piece, reminiscent of Nietzsche’s typewriter. In his later years, Nietzsche, suffering from deteriorating eyesight, put down his pen and took up the typewriter, noting the change in his thought process influenced by the medium. Similarly, Wonik Lee departs from the traditional medium of the brush in painting, acquiring a new language of his own. The result of this exploration process, “Rebirth,” encapsulates a new investigative process within a single piece of artwork.</p>
