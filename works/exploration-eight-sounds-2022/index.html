<p>‘Exploration of Eight Sounds for Live Electronics (2022)’ is a reflective piece on the exhibition 『Sensation and Discovery: Playground of Eight Sounds』. Using sound objects and the Tahyeongo from the exhibition space, this work constructs electronic music by utilizing the movement of stones and the sounds of the Tahyeongo as central elements in a modular synth through live recording. The aim is for the music experienced upon first entering the exhibition space to feel different when leaving.</p>
