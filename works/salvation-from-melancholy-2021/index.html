<p>This work by composer Myungseok Oh is an experimental electronic music piece inspired by the movie “Melancholia.”</p>
<p><strong>Materials</strong>: MAX8, Ableton Live10, Moog Matriarch</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This piece is a transmediation of the film “Melancholia” into live electronics. The film “Melancholia” illustrates that one can escape the inferno of the self through the catastrophic disaster of the great Other. In other words, the atopia of the Other reveals the utopia of Eros. Composer Myungseok Oh, in transmediating “Melancholia,” expressed all the inspiration derived from the film through acoustic and musicological research. Additionally, in the process of transforming the film’s dominant and highly subjective emotion of ‘melancholy,’ he sought to find a universal basis by sonifying the portrait series by visual artist Richard Lewer to convey melancholy.</p>
